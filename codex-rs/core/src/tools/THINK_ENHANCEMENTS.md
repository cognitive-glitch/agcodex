# Think Tool Enhancements - Variable Thinking Intensities

## Overview
The think tool has been enhanced to support variable thinking intensities based on prompt keywords. This allows the tool to automatically adjust its reasoning depth based on the user's needs.

## Key Features

### 1. ThinkingIntensity Enum
Three levels of thinking intensity:
- **Quick** (1x iterations) - Default for simple questions
- **Deep** (2x iterations) - Triggered by "think deeply" or "think hard"
- **VeryDeep** (3x iterations) - Triggered by "think really hard" or "think very deeply"

### 2. Automatic Intensity Detection
The system automatically detects the desired intensity from prompt keywords:
- "think hard", "think deeply" → Deep thinking
- "think really hard", "think very deeply", "maximum thinking" → Very deep thinking
- Default → Quick thinking

### 3. Three Thinking Strategies

#### Sequential Thinking
- Iterative thought refinement
- Steps scale with intensity (3x, 6x, 9x)
- Best for general problems

#### Shannon Methodology
- Systematic problem-solving in phases:
  1. Problem Definition
  2. Constraints Analysis
  3. Model Development
  4. Validation
  5. Implementation Planning
- Uncertainty rounds scale with intensity (2x, 4x, 6x)
- Best for mathematical/systematic problems

#### Actor-Critic Thinking
- Dual perspective analysis
- Actor: Creative, optimistic viewpoint
- Critic: Analytical, cautious evaluation
- Rounds scale with intensity
- Best for evaluative/trade-off problems

### 4. Progress Indication
Every thinking operation now includes:
- Current step and total steps
- Active strategy name
- Current phase description
- Intensity level being used

Example output:
```
[Deep thinking, step 3/6] Analyzing: How to optimize this?
Strategy: Sequential Thinking
Phase: Refining
Progress: 3/6 steps
```

### 5. Smart Strategy Selection
The tool automatically selects the best strategy based on problem keywords:
- "prove", "algorithm", "systematic" → Shannon Methodology
- "evaluate", "pros and cons", "tradeoff" → Actor-Critic
- General questions → Sequential Thinking

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
// Automatically detects Quick intensity
let result = ThinkTool::think("How to implement a cache?")?;

// Triggers Deep thinking
let result = ThinkTool::think("Think deeply about security implications")?;

// Triggers VeryDeep thinking
let result = ThinkTool::think("Think really hard about optimization")?;
```

### With Explicit Strategy
```rust
let tool = ThinkTool::with_strategy(
    ThinkingStrategy::Shannon(ShannonThinking::new(ThinkingIntensity::Deep))
);
```

### Accessing Progress Information
```rust
let result = ThinkTool::think("Think hard about this problem")?;
if let Some(progress) = result.progress {
    println!("Strategy: {}", progress.strategy);
    println!("Progress: {}/{}", progress.current_step, progress.total_steps);
    println!("Intensity: {}", progress.intensity);
}
```

## API Changes

### ThinkResult Structure
Added fields:
- `intensity: Option<ThinkingIntensity>` - The intensity level used
- `progress: Option<ThinkingProgress>` - Progress tracking information

### New Types
- `ThinkingIntensity` - Enum for intensity levels
- `ThinkingProgress` - Progress tracking structure
- `ThinkingStrategy` - Enum for different strategies
- `SequentialThinking` - Sequential strategy implementation
- `ShannonThinking` - Shannon methodology implementation
- `ActorCriticThinking` - Actor-Critic strategy implementation

## Adapter Integration
The tool adapter (`adapters.rs`) has been updated to:
- Include intensity in output JSON
- Include progress information when available
- Format messages to show thinking mode and progress

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite in `think_intensity_test.rs`:
- Intensity detection tests
- Strategy selection tests
- Progress tracking tests
- Integration tests for all intensity levels

## Benefits
1. **Adaptive Reasoning**: Automatically adjusts depth based on problem complexity
2. **Transparent Progress**: Users can see what strategy is being used and progress
3. **Better Results**: More iterations for complex problems lead to better analysis
4. **Strategy Optimization**: Right strategy for the right problem type
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work with sensible defaults

## Implementation Notes
- Intensity multipliers are applied to iteration counts, not time limits
- Strategies maintain their own state for progress tracking
- The tool can be used with or without sessions
- All strategies respect the intensity setting for depth control
