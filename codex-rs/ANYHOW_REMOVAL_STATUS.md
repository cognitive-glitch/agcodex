# Anyhow Dependency Removal Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed anyhow from workspace dependencies
- Removed `anyhow = "1"` from `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root `Cargo.toml`

### 2. Removed anyhow from individual crate dependencies
The following crates had their `anyhow = { workspace = true }` dependency removed from their `Cargo.toml`:

- **chatgpt** - Previously used anyhow
- **apply-patch** - Previously used anyhow (already has thiserror)
- **arg0** - Previously used anyhow
- **core** - Previously used anyhow (already has thiserror)
- **tui** - Previously used anyhow
- **file-search** - Previously used anyhow
- **linux-sandbox** - Previously used anyhow (in target-specific dependencies)
- **cli** - Previously used anyhow
- **protocol-ts** - Previously used anyhow
- **exec** - Previously used anyhow
- **execpolicy** - Previously used anyhow
- **mcp-client** - Previously used anyhow
- **mcp-server** - Previously used anyhow

### 3. Test Support Crate Exception
- **mcp-server/tests/common** - Still uses anyhow (`anyhow = "1"`) as a direct dependency
  - This is a test support crate that was kept as per instructions to not remove from test support crates if still needed

### 4. No anyhow in core/tests/common
- The `core/tests/common` crate does not have anyhow as a dependency

## Remaining Work Required

### Code Migration Still Needed
The following files still contain `anyhow::` references in code and need to be migrated to use thiserror-based error types:

1. **arg0/src/lib.rs** - Functions returning `anyhow::Result`
2. **cli/src/proto.rs** - Uses `anyhow::bail!` and `anyhow::Error`
3. **cli/src/debug_sandbox.rs** - Functions returning `anyhow::Result`
4. **cli/src/main.rs** - Main function returns `anyhow::Result`
5. **chatgpt/** - Multiple files using anyhow for error handling
6. **exec/** - Main and lib using anyhow
7. **file-search/** - Main and lib using anyhow
8. **mcp-client/** - Using `anyhow::anyhow!` macro
9. **mcp-server/** - Main function using anyhow
10. **protocol-ts/** - Using `anyhow::anyhow!` and `anyhow::Context`
11. **tui/** - Main and updates.rs using anyhow
12. **execpolicy/** - Main and parser using anyhow
13. **core/src/error.rs** - Has migration comment for anyhow compatibility
14. **core/src/mcp_connection_manager.rs** - Using `anyhow!` macro

### Migration Strategy

1. **Define domain-specific error types using thiserror** for each crate
2. **Replace `anyhow::Result` with specific `Result<T, DomainError>` types**
3. **Replace `anyhow::bail!` with returning specific error variants**
4. **Replace `anyhow::anyhow!` with specific error construction**
5. **Use `#[from]` attribute in thiserror for automatic conversions**
6. **Update function signatures** to use the new error types

### Example Migration Pattern

```rust
// Before (with anyhow)
use anyhow::{Result, anyhow, bail};

fn do_something() -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    if condition {
        bail!("Something went wrong");
    }
    Ok("success".to_string())
}

// After (with thiserror)
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum MyError {
    #[error("Something went wrong")]
    SomethingWrong,
    
    #[error("IO error: {0}")]
    Io(#[from] std::io::Error),
}

fn do_something() -> Result<String, MyError> {
    if condition {
        return Err(MyError::SomethingWrong);
    }
    Ok("success".to_string())
}
```

## Summary

- ✅ All anyhow dependencies have been removed from Cargo.toml files (except test support crate)
- ❌ Code still contains anyhow usage that needs to be migrated to thiserror
- The project will not compile until the code migration is complete
